# Standardcurve comparison between 4min column and 15min column on mixed mode

In this repository, we will perform a comparison of a standard dilution series of 128 mixed standards measured in a 1:2 dilution series and 1:3 dilution series. Both dilution series were measured in water background (extraction buffer) and matrix background (dilution of murine cecal content). The samples were measured using mixed-mode settings in both positive and negative mode on a ZenoTOF. We also match the 4min standard mix with a single-standard library.

Here, we perform multiple comparisons:

1. Linearity check of the 1:2 and 1:3 standard dilution on a water background for the 4min column
2. Fitting of the linear model for both 1:2 and 1:3 dilutionseries in both positive and negative mode
3. Library matching in both positive and negative mode for the measured retention times
4. Linearity check of the 1:3 standard dilution on a water background for the 15min column
5. Fitting of the linear model for both 4min and 15min column with the 1:3 dilutionseries in both positive and negative mode
6. Determination of the detection limits for both the 4min and 15min column based on the linearity of the standard dilution change
